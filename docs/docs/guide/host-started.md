- Fill in the basic information of the event, including event type, name, date, location, etc., then click "Create campaign".
- It is important to note that when selecting the event type, Hackathon is aimed at solving specific problems or developing innovative projects through team collaboration. This type of event has a certain level of competitiveness, and participants usually need to form teams. On BeWater, when publishing a Hackathon event, team formation functionality will be provided to facilitate participants to collaborate and compete together conveniently. Workshop, on the other hand, is an educational and skill training activity where participants learn specific topics or skills through lectures, hands-on practice, and discussions. Workshop activities typically do not involve competition and do not require participants to form teams. Therefore, when publishing Workshop events on BeWater, team formation functionality is not provided. Organizers should select the appropriate event type based on their needs.
